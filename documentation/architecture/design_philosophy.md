# Design Philosophy

## Core Principles

### 1. Everything is a Module
- Knowledge, capabilities, memories, and identity are all modules
- Modules can be loaded, unloaded, and swapped dynamically
- No hardcoded behaviors - everything is configurable

### 2. Context Drives Everything
- The system adapts based on what you're doing
- Context detection happens automatically
- Modules load/unload based on context needs

### 3. Resources are Sacred
- Memory is limited and must be managed carefully
- Every module has a cost
- Intelligent eviction when space is needed

### 4. Learning Never Stops
- The system learns from every interaction
- Patterns emerge from usage
- Strategies improve over time

### 5. Identity is Fluid but Coherent
- Personality can adapt to context
- Core identity remains stable
- Changes are gradual and natural

## Architectural Principles

### Modularity First
```python
# Bad: Monolithic class
class CortexSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.everything = {}
    
# Good: Focused components
class ModuleRegistry:
    """Only handles module registration"""
    
class ModuleLoader:
    """Only handles loading/unloading"""
    
class ModuleCache:
    """Only handles caching"""
```

### Clear Interfaces
- Each component has a well-defined API
- Dependencies are explicit
- Communication through events

### Fail Gracefully
- Missing modules don't crash the system
- Degraded functionality is better than none
- Always have fallback behavior

### Optimize for Common Cases
- Fast paths for frequent operations
- Lazy loading for rare needs
- Cache aggressively but intelligently

## Development Guidelines

### File Size Limits
- No file larger than 500 lines
- Most files should be 100-300 lines
- If it's getting big, split it up

### Single Responsibility
- Each class does ONE thing well
- Each file contains related functionality
- Each module serves a specific purpose

### Explicit Over Implicit
```python
# Bad: Magic behavior
module.process(input)  # What does this do?

# Good: Clear intent
module.extract_keywords(input)
module.apply_patterns(input)
module.generate_response(input)
```

### Test Everything
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for workflows
- Performance tests for critical paths

## The Cortex Way

Cortex_2 is not just a memory system - it's a new way of thinking about AI cognition. By treating everything as dynamic and modular, we enable:

- **Unlimited virtual knowledge** within finite resources
- **Contextual intelligence** that adapts naturally
- **Persistent identity** across sessions
- **Continuous improvement** through learning

The goal is a system that feels alive, adaptive, and intelligent - not because of complex algorithms, but because of elegant architecture.
